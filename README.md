# Quizzy.js
A little javascript game I made for practice

Setup

To get the server running change in the server directory (QuizzyServer) and run the following commands
npm install (first time only)
node index.js

By default it will start on port 3000

To get the client running (by default on port 8080) run the following commands
npm install (first time only)
npm run dev
